## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to take JSON data for bacterial belly button species, and create an interactive webpage to view this data using javascript. In addition, three visual aids were added to the webpage using Plotly:

1. A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial species per patient, and the frequency that each one occured

2. A bubble chart showing the frequency of all bacterial species per patient, grouped in color by OTU ID

3. A gauge scale showing the frequency of belly button washing per patient
